### Bayes Theorem
![Bayes Theorem](./bayes_theorem.png)

### Concepts
- **"Naive" Bayes**: assume occurrence of features are independent of each other.
- **P(A|B)**: Conditional Probability, the probability of occurrence of event A on the condition of event B.
- **P(A|B)**: Posterior
- **P(B|A)**: Likelihood
- **P(A)**: Prior probability of proposition A
- **P(B)**: Prior probability of evidence B, marginal probability
- **P(A,B)**: Joint probability, both A and B occur, P(A,B)=P(B,A)
